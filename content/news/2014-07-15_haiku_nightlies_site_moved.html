Effective immediately, the Haiku Nightlies page has moved from <a href="http://haiku-files.org/">http://haiku-files.org/</a> to <a href="https://download.haiku-os.org/">https://download.haiku-os.org/</a>.

<br>It was agreed that the nightly downloads location should be a bit more centralized around the main website domain. Oliver and Niels got busy setting up a <a href="https://buildbot.haiku-os.org/">new buildbot instance</a> and the new nightly pages, and finished it sometime last week.<br>
<br>
The "automatic update" repositories have also moved, they can now be (temporarily) found at <a href="https://download.haiku-os.org/haiku-repositories/">https://download.haiku-os.org/haiku-repositories/</a>. Sometime before the next release, these will likely be migrated to <a href="https://packages.haiku-os.org/">https://packages.haiku-os.org/</a>, but this is lower priority for now.
