<p>
If there was ever an example of the saying "Money talks and ...", this is it.
Since publishing the "HAIKU needs you!" article in late August, over $5,000 has been raised!
This is from 110 individuals who made a combined 75 recurring monthly donations and 72 one-time donations.
The yearly total is soaring over $20,000 with the help of 322 donors making 354 recurring and 322 one-time donations.
<strong>Because of their efforts and generosity, we are able to finance another month of contractual development for both Adrien and Pawel!</strong>
Thank you and congratulations to everyone who helped!

<p>
Both developers will continue working on their individual contracts -- Adrien Destugues (aka Pulkomandy) for WebPositive, WebKit and the Services Kit and 
Pawel Dziepak (aka pdziepak) for CPU scheduler and other CPU related features. 
Pawel's work is currently concentrated in a <a href="https://github.com/pdziepak/Haiku/tree/scheduler">"scheduler" branch of Haiku on github</a>
Adrien's work is landing in Haiku's master branch, a <a href="https://github.com/haiku/haiku-webkit/tree/bnetapi">"bnetapi" branch of WebKit on github</a>,
and <a href="http://bb.haikuports.org/haikuports">Haikuports bitbucket repositories</a>.
An early build of HaikuLauncher, a barebones browser for testing the WebKit port, is <a href="http://files.haiku-os.org/files/haikulauncher-20131020.hpkg">available here</a>
</p>

<p>
As you may know, package management has been merged into the main development line (the "master" branch) and are available in the normal nightly images at haiku-files.org
As with any large feature, ironing out all of the wrinkles takes time.  
There are several ways you can help: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>file bugs on dev.haiku-os.org</li>
<li>contribute to Haikuports collection of build recipes</li>
<li>repackage and publish existing software as .hpkg's</li>
<li>engage in conversations on haiku mailing lists (for example the general list [haiku] or the development related questions [haiku-development])</li>
</ul>
 
<p> 
In other news, another developer Julian Harnath (aka jua), has been doing some excellent work and recently received commit access.
One example is <a href="https://github.com/orangejua/haiku/tree/ticket8007">fixing ticket #8007</a>, which refactors the port subsystem locking and alleviates various freezing issues. 
He has started some improvements to MediaKit/MediaPlayer in another <a href="https://github.com/orangejua/haiku/tree/media">github branch, "media"</a>. 
Initially he plans general overall fixes to the MediaKit, the MediaPlayer filters and even some new filter nodes. Time will tell where he goes from ahere.

<p>
Lastly onto finances. At this moment, there's about $18,000 USD in funds. These are the immediate costs that will be paid off shortly: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>&euro;4000 EUR for Oliver's package management contracts, which are winding down.</li>
<li>&euro;2000 EUR for Adrien's first month of contracting</li>
<li>&euro;2000 EUR for Adrien's second month of contracting</li>
<li>$2500 USD for Pawel's first month of contracting</li>
<li>$2500 USD for Pawel's second month of contracting</li>
<li>$400 USD for Ohio Linux Fest</li>
<li>$100 USD for domain renewals</li>
</ul>

<p>
After those transactions, there will be $1200 USD at the end of November. $1000 of that is kept on reserve for unexpected costs. Do you:
