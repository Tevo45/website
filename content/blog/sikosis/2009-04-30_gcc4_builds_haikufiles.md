Just thought we'd let you know that, <a href="http://files.haiku-os.org" target="_blank">Haiku-Files</a> is now hosting GCC4 builds of Haiku in both RAW and VM image formats.

You can obtain these builds in the usual directories and we've updated the RSS feeds as well.

We've also fixed the VMX file that is distributed with the pre-alpha images to have the correct virtual hard disk name. Sorry for this oversight, I wasn't aware of it, until I was playing around with VMware Fusion last night.
